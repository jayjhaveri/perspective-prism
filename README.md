# Perspective Prism

## Project Description

Perspective Prism is an AI-powered thinking companion that transforms any user input â€” a question, idea, dilemma, or draft â€” into responses from multiple distinct personas, such as:

- ðŸ§  The Analyst â€“ Rational, data-driven, structured
- ðŸ’¬ The Empath â€“ Emotionally intuitive, reflective
- ðŸ§˜ The Sage â€“ Philosophical, timeless, poetic
- ðŸš€ The Strategist â€“ Tactical, action-focused
- ðŸŽ¨ The Creator â€“ Playful, humorous, expressive

People often struggle with overthinking, creative blocks, or decision paralysis. Whether itâ€™s a personal dilemma, writing task, or business idea, we tend to see it through a narrow mental lens â€” our own. While general-purpose AI tools (like ChatGPT) can provide answers, they usually reflect a single tone or thinking style. This limits reflection and insight, especially for creators, thinkers, and decision-makers who crave depth, nuance, or emotional clarity.

Perspective Prism helps users rethink their ideas through diverse cognitive and emotional lenses, and even watch those perspectives interact, just like getting feedback from a room full of very different minds.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Perspective Responses:** Enter a prompt and receive five uniquely stylized responses â€” each reflecting a different mindset. This encourages better reflection, decision-making, and creativity.
- **Debate Mode:** Activate Debate Mode to watch personas interact in a turn-based conversation. Each persona replies to the last speaker, not just the user input, mirroring how different minds would respond in a live room. The user can watch the debate unfold turn-by-turn, with an option to interject or ask follow-up questions.
- **Clean, Emotionally Engaging UI:** Web-based interface designed for clarity and inspiration.

## MVP Features

- Input box for idea/dilemma
- Persona selection or default to 5 core personas
- Multi-panel response view for standard mode
- Debate Mode with turn-by-turn persona interaction
- Clean, emotionally engaging UI (web-based)
